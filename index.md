# Introduction

## What is the Arknights Randomizer?
It's an application that randomly chooses operators for a randomly chosen operation. You can select different options and challenges as well to make the gameplay more fun. I know that a lot of players get a little bored in the down time between events (like me), so hopefully this will be a fun way to continue playing the game! I first got the idea from Tectone's [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJnULBeIYXA). You can visit his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPnSoX7NkOBcOX0Gfw_yjAw).

## How do I use it?
It's simple, use the drop down tabs on the left side to select available stages and operators (unless you're a massive whale and have literally all of the operators unlocked). You can also choose the challenges you want to include in the randomizer here. Then, select the options you want to include and press the Randomize button to get your random operation! You can scroll down for a quick description of all the challenges and options.

# Options and Challenges

## Options
- Easy Mode: Guarantees the random operation includes at least 1 Guard, 1 Vanguard, 1 Defender, 1 Medic, 1 Caster, and 1 Sniper. The program will get angry at you if you don't have enough operators in the available pool to satisfy this requirement and you have this option selected.
- No (type of operator): Guarantees that this type of operator will not appear in the operator list.
- No 5/6 Star Operators: Guarantees that no 5/6 star operators will appear (I dare you to do this without a KyoStinV video...)
- Number of operators: Select the number of operators to run the operation with

## Challenges (Credit to Tectone for coming up with most of these challenges in his arknights randomizer video)
- Soul Link: Operators must be placed down or removed in pairs of two. This includes operators dying (if an operator dies, remove another operator with it).
- Permadeath: If an operator dies or is retreated, they cannot be placed down again (Rip Chen helidrop lovers everywhere).
- No Pause: You are not allowed to pause the game at any point during the operation.
- 2x Speed Only: You must play the entire operation at 2x speed.
- No Active Skills: You are not allowed to use active skills on any operator (passive skills or skills that are automatic activation are allowed) (Rip Silverash).

# Difficulty Rating
There is a difficulty rating given to give you a general idea of how hard the operation will be. Honestly, it's a pretty terrible rating system (sorry!) because it doesn't take into account a lot of stuff like how hard it is to try to beat Annihilation 2 without a puller (maybe I'm just garbage at the game). Anyway, here's a list of all the things it does take into account.

## Stages
- Story Stages Chapter 0/1: 0 (Let's be real you could beat these stages with your eyes closed)
- Story Stages Chapter 2/3: 5
- Story Stages Chapter 4/5: 10
- Story Stages Chapter 6: 15 (Because I'm super lazy and haven't done these stages yet myself)
- LS/CA/SK/AP/CE Level 1: 0
- LS/CA/SK/AP/CE Level 2/3: 5
- LS/CA/SK/AP/CE Level 4/5: 10
- PR 1: 5
- PR 2: 10
- Annihilation 1: 10
- Annihilation 2: 30
- Annihilation 3: 35 (I literally have never beaten this without a Silverash...)

## Operator
- 6 star: 1
- 5 star: 2
- 4 star: 3
- 3 star: 4
- 1/2 star: 5
- No operator: 6 (number of empty slots from the full 12 slots)

## Options
- Easy Mode: Whatever the difficulty rating total is, take 75% of it.
- No (type of operator): 10 (for any of the operator types, I know some are harder than others, but I'm deciding these values at like 2 am and I'm kind of tired...)
- No 5/6 Star Operators: Accounted for by the operator star level difficulty ratings above.

## Challenges
- Soul link: 5 (Never tried this one out myself, but it can't be that hard right?)
- Permadeath: 10
- No Pause: 3
- 2x Speed Only: 2 (Honestly does anyone ever play on 1x speed?)
- No Active Skills: 15 (Because rip Silverash, Eyafjalla, Chen, and a whole bunch of other operators)
